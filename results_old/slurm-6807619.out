Overall Scale Dependency Assessment:
WV1 Analysis: SCALE DEPENDENT
  - Statistically significant differences in transfer function ratios
  - Statistically significant differences in scale-dependent sensitivity
  - Statistically significant differences in cross-scale analysis
  - Significant variation in transfer function ratios across scales

WV2 Analysis: SCALE DEPENDENT
  - Statistically significant differences in transfer function ratios
  - Statistically significant differences in scale-dependent sensitivity
  - Statistically significant differences in cross-scale analysis
  - Significant variation in transfer function ratios across scales

Combined Analysis: SCALE DEPENDENT
  - Statistically significant differences in transfer function ratios
  - Statistically significant differences in scale-dependent sensitivity
  - Statistically significant differences in cross-scale analysis
  - Significant variation in transfer function ratios across scales

Statistical Results (Combined Dataset):
Transfer Function Ratios: p-value = 0.000000, SIGNIFICANT
Scale-Dependent Sensitivity: p-value = 0.000000, SIGNIFICANT
Cross-Scale Analysis: p-value = 0.000000, SIGNIFICANT

Conclusion: GMF is SCALE-DEPENDENT based on combined Kruskal-Wallis test (p-value: 0.000000)
